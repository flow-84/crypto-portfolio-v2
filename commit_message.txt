feat: Implement crypto-web-gui enhancements and fixes

This commit includes a series of improvements and bug fixes for the crypto-web-gui:

- **Dependency Management:**
  - Corrected `crypto-cli` import paths in `server.js` and `cacheManager.js`.
  - Added missing `axios` import in `server.js`.
  - Updated `package.json` to use the correct `@sebastienrousseau/crypto-cli` package and a stable `express` version.
  - Updated `@sebastienrousseau/crypto-cli` to version `0.0.1` after verifying available versions.

- **Portfolio Management:**
  - Fixed issue where removed coins reappeared by updating `cacheManager` after deletion.
  - Ensured newly added coins appear immediately by updating the cache and UI directly.
  - Implemented logic to update existing coin amounts when adding more of the same coin.
  - Added a background price fetch for newly added coins to update prices quickly.

- **User Interface & Experience:**
  - Implemented a coin search functionality with suggestions from CoinGecko.
  - Improved the styling of the "Total Portfolio Value" display with a retro, high-contrast look.
  - Modified the title to be a high-contrast ASCII retro title.
